from Friday March 25 Meeting.

current decisions before the group
 1. what elements should be on the iPhone UI?
   > splash page
   > home page
   > first search screen
   > what elements do we display through out the slection process?
   > DetailViewController (variable and static information)

 2. how should the search backend function?
   > how do we have a flat data structure but allow for multi-layer searches
   > mulitple .plist files? XML sort/search algorithm?
