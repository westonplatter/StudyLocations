Notes from Friday March 25 Meeting.
-- notes added by Weston Platter (plat0136@umn.edu)

current decisions before the group
 
 1. what elements should be on the iPhone UI?
    > splash page
    > home page
    > first search screen
    > what elements do we display through out the slection process?
    > DetailViewController (variable and static information)

 2. how should we execute a backend search to generate an array for displayed UINavigationTable?
    > currently have it configured with XML (plist) file.
    > we could custom build our own XML/ORM system.
    > we could implement an SQLite db and package it with the app.
    > with both strategies, app must be able to cache and persist data from web server.
